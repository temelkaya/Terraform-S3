1. Use SSM (System manager)
2. wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/SSMAgent/latest/linux_amd64/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm
3.  sudo yum -y localinstall amazon-ssm-agent.rpm 
4.  sudo systemctl enable amazon-ssm-agent
5.  sudo systemctl start amazon-ssm-agent
6.  sudo systemctl status amazon-ssm-agent
7.  sudo tail -f /var/log/amazon/ssm/amazon-ssm-agent.log --> Check the logs
